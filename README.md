# **Spotify Data Engineering Project (ETL on AWS)**  

## **Overview**  
This project builds an end-to-end **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline** using **AWS** to analyze  
[The 100 Most Streamed Songs on Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5ABHKGoOzxkaa28ttQV9sE).  

The pipeline automates the **extraction, transformation, and storage** of **Spotify song, album, and artist data**,  
making it queryable using **AWS Athena** for analysis.

---

## **Architecture Overview**  
The pipeline follows the **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process**, as illustrated below:

### **1. Extract Phase**  
- **Data Source:** The **Spotify API** provides metadata about songs, albums, and artists.  
- **AWS Lambda (Data Extraction):**  
  - A Lambda function (`spotify_api_data_extract`) fetches **raw JSON data** from Spotify.  
  - This function runs at scheduled intervals, triggered by **Amazon CloudWatch Events**.  
  - Extracted data is stored in an **S3 bucket (`raw_data/to_process`)**.  

### **2. Transformation Phase**  
- **AWS Lambda (Data Transformation):**  
  - A second Lambda function (`spotify_data_transform`) is triggered when new raw data is added to S3.  
  - It processes the raw JSON, extracts key fields (e.g., song name, artist, album, popularity), and converts them into **structured CSV files**.  
  - The transformed data is stored in a separate **S3 bucket (`transformed_data`)**.  

### **3. Load Phase**  
- **AWS Glue Crawler:**  
  - Scans the transformed **CSV files** in S3.  
  - Infers schemas dynamically and creates tables in the **AWS Glue Data Catalog**.  
- **AWS Glue Data Catalog:**  
  - Stores metadata about the tables for easy querying.  
- **AWS Athena:**  
  - Connects to the Glue tables to enable **SQL-based querying** of the transformed data.

## **Conclusion**  
This project demonstrates how **AWS serverless technologies** can be leveraged to build a scalable **ETL pipeline**  
for **Spotify data analysis**. By automating data ingestion, transformation, and storage,  
it provides a powerful foundation for querying **streaming music insights** efficiently.
